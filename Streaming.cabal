build-type:          Simple
synopsis:            A free monad transformer optimized for streaming applications.
                     
description:         `Stream` can be used wherever `FreeT` is used. The compiler's
                     standard range of optimizations work better for operations 
                     written in terms of `Stream`. See the examples in @Streaming.Prelude@ 
                     for a sense of how simple the library is to use and think about.
                     . 
                     @Streaming.Prelude@ closely follows 
                     @Pipes.Prelude@, but cleverly /omits the pipes/. It is focused 
                     on employment with a base functors which generate
                     effectful sequences: e.g. 
                     .
                     > pipes:      Producer a m r, Producer a m (Producer a m r), FreeT (Producer a m) m r
                     > io-streams: InputStream a, Generator a r
                     > conduit:    Source m a, ConduitM () o m r
                     .
                     and the like.
                     .
                     Interoperation with 
                     <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes pipes>
                     is accomplished with this isomorphism:
                     .  
                     > Pipes.unfoldr Streaming.next        :: Stream (Of a) m r   -> Producer a m r
                     > Streaming.unfoldr Pipes.next        :: Producer a m r      -> Stream (Of a) m r                     
                     .
                     (If you don't have @pipes-HEAD@, inline the definition of <https://github.com/Gabriel439/Haskell-Pipes-Library/blob/master/src/Pipes/Prelude.hs#L909 unfoldr>.) 
                     .
                     Interoperation with 
                     <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams io-streams> 
                     is thus:
                     .
                     > Streaming.reread IOStreams.read     :: InputStream a       -> Stream (Of a) IO ()
                     > IOStreams.unfoldM Streaming.uncons  :: Stream (Of a) IO () -> IO (InputStream a)
                     .
                     The purposes of the separate @Generator a r@ type in @io-streams@ can as well be met with 
                     @Stream (Of a) m r@, which admits more complex manipulations. It should
                     be somewhat friendlier to the compiler. 
                     .
                     A simple exit to <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit conduit> would be, e.g.:
                     .
                     > Conduit.unfoldM Streaming.uncons    :: Stream (Of a) m ()  -> Source m a
                     .
                     These conversions should never be more expensive than a single @>->@ or @=$=@.
